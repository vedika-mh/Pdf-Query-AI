The analysis highlights three key points: First, the dividend effect \\nis estimated to be around  one percentage points per annum for the period 1981 – 2015 after controlling for \\ncore policy variables. Second, the significance of interaction effects and ins trumental variable results \\nstrengthen the argument that the working age population can promote economic growth only if they are \\nequipped with good health, quality education, and decent employment opportunities. And third,  the working \\nage population  explains the maximum portion of the inequality in per capita income  across states. Thus, \\nIndia needs to work towards enhancing the quality of education and health care along with employment \\nopportunities for the growing working age population. Job generati on and spending on health and education \\nis the key for reaping maximum dividend from demographic windows of opportunity .  \\n \\nKeywords : Demographic Dividend , Economic Growth, Population  Growth, Working Age Population , \\nHealth, Education, Employment  \\nJEL Classification  Numbers : J10, J11  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3 \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\n \\nThe impact of demographic factors, mainly population size and its growth, on economic \\ndevelopment has long been represented by three major contesting views in the literature – the \\npessimistic theory, the optimistic theory and the neutralist theory  (Coale & Hoover, 1958; Birdsall, \\nKelly, & Sinding , 2003 ). But these growth debates have ignored the effect of changes in age \\nstructure (due to variable population growth) on economic performance. It is only after  the late \\neighties and particularly the late nineties , the significance of age structure and the resulting \\nemergence of “ Demographic Dividend ” got acknowledged in the growth literature (Bloom & \\nFreeman , 1988; Bloom & Sachs , 1998; Bloom & Williamson , 1998; Bloom, Canning & Sevilla , \\n2001; Higgins & Williamson , 1997 ; Mason , 2001).  \\n \\nThe concept of ‘Demographic Dividend’1 emanates when an economy moves from the second \\nstage to the third stage of demographic transition process in which the birth rates begi n to fall, \\ncoupled with a falling death rate and leads to subsequent shift in the age structure of the population \\ntowards working age group (15 -59) relative to the population of dependents (0 -14 and 60+). \\nAmong the dependents, the child population falls dr amatically while that of the old age population \\ngrows only moderately thereby creating opportunities for growth ( Bloom , 2011 ).  \\n \\nThe rising share of working age population creates a potential for many benefits: first, an increase \\nin the labor force who pro duce more than they consume. Second, lower fertility rate induces greater \\nparticipation of females in the labor market. Third, greater investment in health, education , and \\nskills of the population as lower resources are ne eded to be diverted for child cari ng and rearing. \\nFourth, household savings increase as working age people are more capable of saving than the \\ndependents and accord capital for investment purposes. The f ifth argument follows from the Life -\\nCycle Hypothesis which states that people in the wo rking age save more for their retirement due \\nto improvements  in life expectancy (Bloom, Canning, & Sevilla , 2003; Bloom , 2011 ; James, 2008 ; \\nKumar, 2013). However, the realization of DD is conditional on the existing policy environment \\nsuch as bett er education, skills, and health,  and disability outcomes, growing employment \\n                                                           \\n1 From now onwards, Demographic Dividend is abbreviated as DD throughout the paper.  \\n \\n4 \\n \\nopportunities for a rapidly growing young population, trade openness , etc. Also, this dividend is \\ntransitory in nature and vanishes over time with further demographic changes.  \\n \\nIt is in this context, the focus of this paper is to estimate the impact of demographic factors on \\neconomic growth in India, which has emerg ed as both a demographic and an economic giant in \\nthe world. Its population is around 18 percent of the world’s populat ion and its Gross Domestic \\nProduct (GDP) growth at about 6.8 percent in 2018 -19 makes it the world's fastest -growing  major \\neconomy (Economic Survey, 2019). It is found that India is on the edge of the ‘demographic \\nrevolution’ with the rapidly rising share of the working -age population from approximately 58 \\npercent in 2000 to nearly 64 percent in 2040. Furthermore, the population estimates suggest that \\nthe average age of the population in India by 2020 will be 29 years while in other countries such \\nas USA, Europe , and Japan, it will be 40 years, 46 years and 47 years respectively (National policy \\nfor skill developm ent and entrepreneurship report, 2015). This indicates that India is one of the \\n‘youngest large nations’ in the world which is expected to have a potential growth -inducing impact \\non the economy (Chandrasekhar , Ghosh, & Roychwdhury , 2006 ; James , 2008 ; Lee & Mason, \\n2006 ; Mason , 2005).  \\n \\nThis paper is timely and relevant as India has just entered the 37 year s of the window of DD \\nopportun ity beginning f rom 2018 to 2055. Also, there is huge inter -state variations in the \\navailability of this window with some states like southern and western states have seen the closing \\nof their DD phase while the window of opportunity has just begun in states like Bihar, J harkhand, \\nMadhya Prades h, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh (UNFPA, 2019).  \\n \\nAkin to global literature, the present empirical analyses in India comprises of both optimistic and \\npessimistic views on India’s potential of realizing DD. Therefore, this paper  endeavors to do a \\nbetter assessment of demographic change and economic implications in India through the \\nfollowing ways: First, it comprehensively assesses the DD for twenty -five states of India for the \\ntime period 1981 – 2015. Secondly, it employs robust econometric models such as Pooled OLS \\nModel, Panel  Data Regression  Model, Barro Conditional Regression Model, Instrumental Variable \\nModel , and Regression -Based Inequality Decomposition Model under which a range of core policy \\nvariables are controlled to ha ve a real demographic effect (explained in detail in data and methods \\n5 \\n \\nsection). Third, though the existing literature on this issue has theoretically argued that working \\nage population can have a significant impact on per capita income only if it is equipp ed with good \\nhealth, quality education, and decent employment opportunities (Chandrasekhar et al. (2006); \\nDesai (2010); Goli and Pandey (2010); James (2011) and James and Goli (2016); Joe et al. (2018)). \\nThis dominant view has been examined empirically thr ough the use of interaction effects and \\ninstrumental variable model (Two -Stage Least Square 2SLS). Lastly, this paper makes a \\nsignificant contribution to the existing literature on this issue by exploring a new dimension in \\nwhich the role of working age po pulation in the growing income inequality across Indian states \\nhave been checked by using Regression -Based Inequality Decomposition Model which in our \\nknowledge has not been attempted by any other study.  \\n \\nThe rest of this paper is organized as: Section 2 discusses stylized facts on India’s changing \\ndemographic profile. Section 3 provides a literature review on DD (both global and Indian \\nexperience). Section 4 deals with methods and data. Section 5 estimates  the DD by using various \\nmodels for the period 1981 -2015. Section 6 focu ses on challenges in the way of realizing DD and \\nSection 7 concludes.   \\n \\n2. Stylized Facts on India’s Changing Demographic Profile  \\n \\nAn analysis of India’s population since 1856 reveals that there has been a marginal increase in the \\npopulation before independence but it rises tremendously thereafter to 1.2 billion in 2011 . Its size  \\nis estimated to rise further to reach 1.7 billion people by 206 0 but after thi s, a downfall in \\npopulation size is projected (Fig.  1). The trends in the exponential growth rate of the population at \\nall India level displays an inverted U -shaped pattern with continuously falling population growth \\nrate recorded since 1990 -91 (Fig.  2). This pattern of decreasing exponential growth rate of \\npopulation is also discernible in all the states of India, except for Tamil Nadu where the growth \\nrate of population is small and the present increase in its population growth is mainly attributed to \\nits inward migration  (Fig.  3). Therefore, to comprehend this eccentric pattern of demographic \\nchange in India,  one has to delve into the underlying forces of fertilit y and mortality (James and \\nGoli, 2016).  \\n \\n6 \\n \\nSource : World Population Prospects (19 th Revision),  United Nations 2019 . \\nFig. 1.

The mortality rate captured by In fant mortality rate (IMR) has gone down \\nfrom 129 per 1,000 live births in 1971 to 33 per 1,000 live births in 2017 . The Total Fertility Rate \\n(TFR) has fallen from 5.2 children per woman in 1971 to 2.2 children per woman in 2017, almost \\ntouching the replace ment fertility level of 2.1 children per woman.

It is estimated that the percentage \\nof the old age population will go up from 5.7 percent in 2000 to 33.2  percent in 2100 , surpassing \\nthe estimated child population. Even the working age pop ulation will continue to increase till 2035 \\nand experience a downfall thereafter  (Fig.  8). Further, the trends in the share o f the working -age \\npopulation across different  states of India (Fig.  9) highlight that the share of the working age \\npopulation is ri sing across all the states of India  (except for Meghalaya) . But there is heterogeneity \\nin its share with the proportion ranging  between 55 percent for Bihar to 69.5  percent for Manipur  \\nin 2011.

Literature review  \\nDemographic Dividend: Global and Indian Experience  \\n \\nThe interest in DD began with the developing countries - especially the Asian countries  - as they \\nwere having a relatively higher population and started experiencing a fertility decline. The \\ntransition occurred first in Japan among all the Asian countries, starting around 1964 and lasting \\ntill 2004. Then subsequently East and Southe ast Asian countries began to reap the advantages of \\nDD. It was estimated that nearly one -third of the economic growth (i.e. per capita GDP growth) \\nbetween 1960 and 2010 of East Asian countries could be due to DD (Bloom & Williamson , 1998; \\nBloom, Canning, & Malaney , 2000 ; Mason, 2001) . However, the study by Navaneetham (2002) \\nfailed to obtain similar results in the case of Latin American countries. It is due to differences in \\nthe policies related to public health, education, flexible labor market, good governance, fam ily \\nplanning, trade openness adopted by different countries (Bloom et al. , 2003).  \\n 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.0\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nAssam\\nBihar\\nGujarat\\nHaryana\\nHimachal Pradesh\\nJammu and Kashmir\\nKarnataka\\nKerala\\nMadhya Pradesh\\nMaharashtra\\nOdisha\\nPunjab\\nRajasthan\\nTamil Nadu\\nUttar Pradesh\\nWest Bengal\\nArunachal Pradesh\\nManipur\\nMeghalaya\\nNagaland\\nTripura\\nSikkim\\nGoa\\nDelhiWorking age share ( % )\\n1981 2011\\n12 \\n \\nIn the Indian context,  a few studies  present pessimistic viewpoints on the issue of India’s potential \\nin reaping the DD. The studies by Acharya (2004); Chandrasekhar et al . (2006); Mitra and \\nNagarajan (2005) ; Desai (2010); Goli and Pandey (2010); James (2011) and  James and Goli (2016) \\nhave  theoretically argued that DD alone cannot bring about an impetus to growth in the country. \\nThe DD just creates a supply -side potential and cannot be realized unless the growing work ing age \\npopulation’s skills have been enhanced and accommodated in employment .  \\n \\nWhile Indian studies having empirical  estimation  (James , 2008;  Aiyar & Mody , 2011; Bloom , \\n2011 ; Ladusingh & Naraya na, 2011;  Kumar , 2013; Joe , Kumar, & Rajpal , 2018) have  rather  found \\na favourable impact of working -age population on economic growth. The study by James (2008) \\nundertook the analysis for the period 1971 -2001 by using two -stage least square (2SLS) method, \\nhowever, it failed to check the impact of growth in the share of the wo rking age population, the \\nmost important component of DD. Kumar (2013) study removed this deficiency but remained \\nskeptical about future growth prospects for India due to the major share of the rise in the working \\nage population in the economically weaker states which have poor infrastructure and a dearth of \\nproper policies to absorb the growing workforce. Another study by Aiyar and Mody (2011) found \\naround 40 to 50 percent of the per capita income growth in India since the 1970s is due to DD after \\ncorrecti ng for inter -state migration and using a two -stage procedure to check for endogen eity issue. \\nBut unlike Bloom and Canning (2004), this study did not find DD to be dependent on the policy \\nenvironment  which seems to be impractical in the Indian context . A re cent study by Joe et al . \\n(2018)  findings  and analytical approach is inconclusive as it did not find a significant impact of \\ngrowth in the share of the working -age population  on the  per capita income  growth  and failed to \\ncontrol for key policy variables.  \\n \\n4. Data and Methods   \\n4.1 . Data source and Variables  \\n \\nThis study compiles data from widely acceptable and reliable sources for 25 states  of India  \\n(Andhra  Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, \\nKarnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar \\nPradesh, West Bengal , Delhi, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripur a, \\n13 \\n \\nSikkim, and Goa ) during  1981 to 2015 . A stacked time -series panel data is constructed for 25 \\nstates * 2 time periods having a total 50 cases. The study variables are grouped into outcome \\nvariable, predictor variables , and covariates. The per capita Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) \\n(1981 to 2015) obtained from the Central Statistics  Organization (indexed to 2011 -12 constant \\nprices) is the outcome variable .  The working age population ratio (15 – 59 years) both level and \\ngrowth (1981 – 2011) in percentage  terms is considered as the main predictor variable of economic \\ngrowth. Besides, other covariates of economic growth are taken to check for the robustness of the \\ndemographic factor ( see appendix Table A1 for details).  \\n \\n4.2  Methods  \\n \\nThe empirical analysis is done in five parts.  \\n \\nI. Pooled OLS Model  \\nThis model is run to check for per capita income level correlates.

Panel Data Regression Model  \\nThis model is employed as it controls for variables that are not directly observable or measurable \\nacross states like cultural factors or variables that change over time but not across entities. To \\ndecide between which panel data regression model to be used: fixed or random effects, the \\nHausman test is used wit h the null hypothesis that the preferred model is random effects and the \\nalternative hypothesis is that the fixed effects model should be used.

Conditional Barro Regression Model  \\nThe general equation of conditional barro regression model is as follows:  \\n𝑔𝑦= λ (Xβ+p+𝑤𝑜−𝑦𝑜)+𝑔𝑤)                                                                                                    \\n \\nThe above equation links growth in income per capita (𝑔𝑦) to a range of explanatory variable X \\nthat determine steady -state labor productivity, the initial level of income per capita 𝑦𝑜, and the \\nratio of working age to the total population 𝑤𝑜 and its growth rate 𝑔𝑤. The constant term captures \\nthe participation rate p.

Instrumental Variable Model  \\nIn this model, the impact of working age share on per capita income is assessed by instru menting \\nit with health loss index, years of schooling , and workforce participation rate. The statistical \\nexpression for the model is as follows:  \\n \\n𝐿𝑜𝑔 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎  𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑃 𝑖𝑡 = α +  𝛽0 ( 𝐿𝑜𝑔 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑎𝑔𝑒  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 𝑖𝑡=\\n𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡 ℎ 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠  𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 𝑖𝑡,𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑡,𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘  𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒  𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑖𝑡) +   \\n16 \\n \\n𝛽1 𝑈𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 log𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠  𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑  𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛   + 𝛽3 \\n𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙  𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟  𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒  +𝑢𝑖𝑡. \\n \\nWhere, 𝐿𝑜𝑔 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎  𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑃 𝑖𝑡 is the dependent variable.  𝐿𝑜𝑔 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑎𝑔𝑒  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 𝑖𝑡 is the \\nmain predictor variable and it is instrumented by  Health loss index , Years o f schooling , and \\nWorkforce participation rate . Rest other explanatory variables have usual interpretation.  \\n \\nV. Regression -Based Inequality Decomposition Model  \\nIn this  model , the inequality in per capita income is decomposed by using the regression -based \\napproach. In this method, first , an income -generating function is set as  \\n ln(𝑦𝑖)= α + ∑𝛽𝑘 𝑥𝑖𝑘+ 𝜀 𝑘  \\nWhere y is per capita income, x is a vector of explanatory variable and  𝜀 is the residual term.  \\nThen following Shorrocks (1982), and Fields & Yoo  (2000), the contribution of each variable to \\ntotal per capita income inequality can be assessed as follows:  \\n𝜎 2(y)=∑ 𝛽𝑖 𝑘\\n𝑖=1cov(y,𝑥𝑖)+ 𝜎 2(ε)  \\nWhere, 𝜎 2(y) is the variance of y, cov(y,𝑥𝑖) represents the covariance of y with each variable ( 𝑥𝑖) \\nand this term can be considered as the contribution of the factor components to total per capita \\nincome inequality.  \\n \\n5. Empirical Estimation  \\n \\nThe descriptive statistics given  in appendix Table A1 highlights that there are huge demographic \\nand economic variations  in India as visible in stark differences between the maximum and \\nminimum values of all the variables. The main variable of interest – the share of the working age  \\npopulation  varies  from 50 .25 percent to 69.50 percent across states over time. Similar is the case \\nwith log per capita NSDP. Human capital  variables  such as literacy rate,  graduate share,  life \\nexpectancy  at birth , disability share  and other political  and economic  variables  also de monstrate \\nglaring variation across states over time. This heterogeneity provides the basis for further research.  \\n \\n17 \\n \\nTable 1 estimates the per capita income correlates for the time period 1981 -2015 by using the \\nPooled OLS mod el.  Model 1 to 4 first asses ses the prime determinants of DD individually that is \\nthe share of working age population, life expectancy at birth , years of schooling  and workforce \\nparticipation rate. It highlights that the log of working age ratio is the single most important \\ncorrelate of  per capita income ( 𝛽0= 8.66 , p<0.01) followed by human capital v ariables  (life \\nexpectancy at birth  and years of schooling)  and employment. Model 5 to  7 include interactions \\nbetween working age share and health, education and employment factors. The resul ts emphasize \\nthat educated  working age population (shown by interaction between log of working age ratio and \\nyears of schooling  in model 6 ) and employed working age population (appearing as interaction \\nbetween log of working age ratio and workforce participation rate  in model 7 ) has a positive \\nsignificant association with per capita income, controlling for other factors. Other significant \\ndeterminants of per capita income are urbanization rate, log of gross fixed capital formation, \\ninfrastructure index, and log of net sown area.  The problem of multicollinearity among the \\nexplanatory variables is checked by using the varianc e inflation factor (VIF) method . All the \\nmodels are  statistically good  as suggested by  the high value of Adjusted R -square.  \\n \\nTable 2 re -estimates the per capita income determinants by using the Panel model as it controls for \\nvariables that are not directly observable or measurable across states . Hausman  test is conducted \\nto decide between fixed and random effects. The value of R -square is satisfactorily high in all four \\nmodels. The result highlights that the working age population share remains a significant \\ndetermining factor of per capita income in all  the models. Also, the interaction term between \\nworking age ratio and years of schooling is statistically significant (𝛽2= 0.074 , p<0.01)  in model \\n3, controlling for other factors , which suggests that education is a pre -condition in augmenting \\nworking age  population impact on per capita income. All other control variables  have expected \\nsigns  and are statistically significant.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n18 \\n \\nTable  1 \\nAnalysis of Per Capita Income correlates based on Pooled OLS  Regression Model  \\n (1) (2) (3) (4) \\nVARIABLES  Model 1  Model 2  Model 3  Model 4  \\n     \\nLog working age ratio  8.661***     \\n(0.912)     \\nLife expectancy   0.0938***    \\n (0.0117)    \\nYears of schooling    0.493***   \\n  (0.0407)   \\nWorkforce participation \\nrate     0.0895***  \\n   (0.0145)  \\nConstant  -24.72***  4.589***  8.527***  7.146***  \\n (3.676)  (0.727)  (0.167)  (0.522)  \\nR-squared  0.74 0.71 0.77 0.47 \\n \\n (5) (6) (7) \\nVARIABLES  Model 5  Model 6  Model 7  \\n    \\nLog working age ratio  7.488***   5.331***  \\n(1.258)   (1.590)  \\nLog working age ratio *Health loss index  -0.0787    \\n(0.0900)    \\nLog working age ratio *Years of schooling   0.0923***   \\n (0.0116)   \\nLog working age ratio*Workforce participation rate    0.00991**  \\n  (0.00427)  \\nUrbanization rate   0.00813**   \\n (0.00384)   \\nLog gross fixed capital formation   0.0854***   \\n (0.0310)   \\nInfrastructure index  1.362**   1.673**  \\n (0.619)   (0.626)  \\nSocial sector expenditure  0.0178    \\n(0.0165)    \\nLog net sown area  -0.00483   -0.105*  \\n(0.0531)   (0.0565)  \\nConstant  -20.34***  7.844***  -12.25*  \\n (5.042)  (0.335)  (6.134)  \\n    \\nObservations  50 50 50 \\nGroups  25 25 25 \\nR-squared  0.76 0.81 0.80 \\nAdjusted R -squared  0.74 0.80 0.78 \\nVariance Inflation Factor  1.8 1.7 2.1 \\n19 \\n \\nDependent variable is log per capita Net State Domestic Product.

In model 3, the individual impact of log of working age ratio is not \\nconsidered due to high pair wise correlation between log of working age ratio and years of schooling  \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\nNext , the results from the Conditional Barro Convergence model (Table 3 ) bring out the positive, \\nstatistically significant and large impact of demographic factor  - the initial share of working age \\npopulation and its growth over the period (1981 -2011) on the per capita income growth (1981 – \\n2015). In model 1,  an increase of one percent in the growth rate of working age ratio is associated \\nwith an increase of 1.63 percent in average annual per capita income growth ( 𝛽1= 1.63, p<0.05 ) \\nand a one percent rise in the initial working age ratio leads to around seventeen percent rise in per \\ncapita income growth over the period ( 𝛽0= 17.88 , p<0.01). The sign of log of initial per capita \\nincome is negative but not significant, suggesting weak convergence across states. Then in models \\n2 to 5, the robustness of demographic factors is checked by controlling core policy variabl es. The \\nmodel 's explanatory power improve significantly with  adjusted R -square  reaching  65 percent . In \\nmodel 5, when all socio -economic factors are controlled, the point estimate of the growth rate of \\nthe working age ratio is still quantitatively stable an d has a significant impact on per capita income \\ngrowth ( 𝛽1 = 1.05, p<0.05 ). The coefficient of the initial working age ratio reduces substantial ly \\nin magnitude  (𝛽0= 9.54, p<0.05) after controlling other factors . Further, among the core policy \\nvariables, only the credit – deposit ratio is having a significantly positive  impact on per capita \\nincome growth.2  \\n \\nIn Table 4 the estimates of the Conditional Barro regression model are extended to include the \\ninteraction effect of age structure variable with initi al health factor, initial education factor, and \\ninitial workforce participation rate. The models are a good fit as suggested by the high value of \\nAdjusted R -square. The results bring to notice  the importance of health and employment in \\nrealizing DD. It indicates that the impact of the increase in working age share on per capita growth \\nis reduced significantly (𝛽0 = - 0.69, p<0.01)  when the working age suffers from health burden \\n(captured by the  interaction between growth in working age share and health loss index in model \\n1), controlling for other factors . Similarly, in model 3 the impact of the increase in working age \\n                                                           \\n2 The existing literature argues that there is a contemporaneous relation between per capita income growth and \\nworking age population growth due to the migration effect. People of working age tend to migrate to regions \\nexperiencing better economic developme nt and thereby leading to higher growth in the working age population in \\nthat region. However, the inter -state migration in India has been found to be less responsive to per capita income \\ndifferences due to the presence of resistance from local labour unio ns, strong linguistic and cultural barriers and \\npaucity of urban shelter for migrants (Cashin & Sahay, 1996; Datta, 1985; Skeldon, 1986; Aiyar & Mody, 2011). Also, \\nthe data on migration for the period 2011 from the Census of India was not available at the time of writing this \\npaper. So the growth rate in the working age population could not be adjusted for migration effect.  \\n21 \\n \\nshare gets enhanced when working age people are employed (𝛽2 = 0.015, p<0.05 ), controlling for \\nother factors .  \\n \\nTable 3  \\nEstimates of Demographic Dividend from Conditional Barro Convergence Regression \\nModel  \\n (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \\nVARIABLES  Model 1  Model 2  Model 3  Model 4  Model 5  \\n      \\nLog initial working \\nage ratio  17.88***  17.99***  13.95***  9.357**  9.537**  \\n(3.826)  (3.936)  (4.668)  (4.295)  (4.485)  \\nGrowth in working \\nage ratio  1.630**  1.402**  2.290**  1.210**  1.054**  \\n(0.773)  (0.603)  (0.804)  (0.465)  (0.445)  \\nLog initial per capita \\nincome  -0.195  -0.0781  -0.0370  -0.257  -0.215  \\n(0.493)  (0.398)  (0.383)  (0.283)  (0.253)  \\nDisability share   -3.930*    -2.024  \\n  (1.967)    (1.478)  \\nGraduate share   -0.187    -0.00213  \\n  (0.109)    (0.115)  \\nUrbanization rate    0.0169    \\n   (0.0230)    \\nGovernance index    0.124*    \\n   (0.0703)    \\nInfrastructure index     0.645   \\n    (1.504)   \\nCredit/deposit ratio     0.0341***  0.0307**  \\n    (0.0114)  (0.0116)  \\nConstant  -71.89***  -71.60***  -61.54***  -37.85**  -37.62*  \\n (13.82)  (15.95)  (19.26)  (17.43)  (18.18)  \\n      \\nObservations  50 50 50 50 50 \\nGroups  25 25 25 25 25 \\n      \\nR-squared  0.55 0.63 0.64 0.72 0.74 \\nAdjusted R -squared  0.48 0.53 0.54 0.64 0.65 \\nVariance inflation \\nfactor  1.2 1.3 1.6 1.5 1.7 \\nDependent variable is growth in per capita net state domestic product (1981 – 2015) .

The Two -Stage Least Square (2SLS) estimates highlight \\nthe statistical significant bearing of working age share on per capita income  (𝛽0 = 7.99 p<0.01 ), \\ncontrolling for other factors. The instruments used are valid as per the test of over -identifyi ng \\nrestrictions and th e value of F -statistic shows that instruments are not weekly correlated with the \\nendogenous regressors.  Also, under the endogen eity test, the null hypothesis of the exogeneity of \\nthe working age share  is rejected at a conv entional level of significance . Therefore, this model \\nreassures that the working age population works through the channels of quality education, good \\nhealth , and decent employment opportunities to promote economic growth.  \\n \\nNext, the relative contribution of the working age population in explaining per capita income  \\ninequality  across states over the period (1981 – 2015)  is compute d based on the Regression -Based \\nInequal ity Decomposition Model . In this method, three different models of pooled OLS regression \\nare run based on the correlation among the explanatory variables  (given in Appendix Table A2) . \\nBased on these regression results, Table 6 highlight s that the maximum portion of per capita \\nincome inequality is attributable to divergent share of the working age population across states.  \\nAround 37 percent to 52 percent of income inequality is contributed by working age share across \\nstates, once we control for other core economic variables. The next important variable  significantly  \\ncontributing to inequality  is the  health factor captured by the life expectancy rate (around 35 \\npercent). Besides this, the varying rate of urbanization across states also significantly causes \\nincome inequality (around 20 percent), followed by social sector expenditure (around 9 percent) \\nand availability of infrastructure (6 percent). Surprisingly, the relative contribution of literacy rate  \\nand employment  to explain income inequality do not turn out to be significant, possibly pointing \\ntowards their poor quality. Around 20 percent of the  income  inequality is still unexplained as \\nsuggested by the residual term.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\nTable 5  \\nImpact of Demography on Per Capita Income through Instrumental Variable s Model  \\n  \\nVARIABLES  2SLS  \\n  \\nLog working age ratio  7.992***  \\n (1.735)  \\nUrbanization rate  0.00889  \\n (0.00627)  \\nLog gross fixed capital formation  0.0244  \\n (0.0305)  \\nSocial sector expenditure  0.00918  \\n (0.0142)  \\nConstant  -22.60***  \\n (6.659)  \\n  \\nObservations  50 \\nGroups  25 \\nR-squared  0.77 \\nDependent variable is log per capita NSDP  \\nRobust Standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.  \\nPopulation adjusted weighted regression  \\n \\nInstrumented : Log working age ratio  \\nInstruments : Health loss index , Years of schooling, Wor kforce participation rate  \\n  \\nFirst stage F statistic  23.38  \\n \\nOver -identifying Restrictions  \\nHo: zero correlation between instruments and the error term  \\n  Sargan chi2(2)        =  2.05555  (p = 0.3578)  \\n  Basmann chi2(2)     =   1.84357  (p = 0.3978)  \\n  Score chi2(2)          =   2.13991  (p = 0.3430)  \\n  \\n \\nExogeneity of instrumented explanatory variable   \\nH0: Variable is exogenous  \\n  Robust score chi2(1)            =   8.60546  (p = 0.0034)  \\n  Robust regression F(1,44)    =   8.66364  (p = 0.0052)  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n25 \\n \\nTable 6  \\nContribution of Demography to Inter -State Inequality in Per Capita Income  \\n (1) (2) (3) \\nVARIABLES  Model 1  Model 2  Model 3  \\nLog working age ratio  39.01***  51.29***  36.48***  \\nLife expectancy  34.77***    \\nLiteracy rate   18.60   \\nWork force participation rate    10.21  \\nUrbanization rate    19.58***  \\nLog gross fixed capital formation    5.28 \\nInfrastructure index  5.70**  4.66  \\nSocial sector expenditure   1.92 9.22**  \\nLog net sown area  0.41 0.45  \\nResidual  20.10  23.05  19.19  \\nTotal  100 100 100 \\nDependent variable is log per capita Net State Domestic Product.

Challenges in the way of realizing Demographic Dividend  \\n \\nGiven the fact that the window of DD has just started in 2018 and will continue till 2055, the \\ncurrent demographic transition has not been accompanied by requisite socio -econom ic changes \\nwhich pose some of the serious growth constraints mentioned below:  \\n \\nFirst, the public investments in social infrastructure in India are abysmal. The total expenditure on \\nhealth as a percentage of GDP is scarcely 1.5 percent while the global average is around 6 percent. \\nThis meager budgetary allocation on health has resulte d in escalating out -of-pocket expenditure of \\npeople. Although there is tremendous improvement in health indicators like Maternal Mortality \\nRate, Infant Mortality Rate, Under -five Mortality Rate, Life Expectancy at Birth over the past few \\nyears, yet due to prevalence of chronic illnesses and disabilities, the diseases adjusted life \\nexpectancy in India is only 53.5 years (Goli & Pandey , 2010; James & Goli, 2016). Further, there \\nis a disparity in health infrastructure in rural areas which has led to inter -state variations in health \\nindicators. For instance, as per the Economic Survey (2018 – 19), states with shortfalls of doctors \\nand specialists have higher rural IMR and MMR as compared to other states. Thus, the goals of \\n26 \\n \\naccessible, affordable and quality heal th care require adequate infrastructure facilities, proper \\nmonitoring of the staff, and provision of essential supplies. On the education front, the government \\nspending on education as a percent of GDP is merely 3 percent in 2018 – 19 (Economic Survey \\n2018  – 19). Though there is remarkable progress in India’s Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in the \\nprimary and secondary level, it is significantly lower in higher education (25.8 percent in 2017 -18 \\nas per MHRD provisional data). Also, there is a disparity in highe r education level s across gender \\nand backward social groups (Educational Statistics at a Glance 2018  cited in  Economic Survey \\n2018 – 19). The literacy rate has touched 77 percent mark in 2017 – 18 (PLFS Annual report 2017 -\\n18), but the learning outcomes are  still miserable. The Annual Status of Education Report (2018) \\ncited in  Economic Survey (2018 – 19) highlights that 1 out of 4 children leaving class VIII lack \\nbasic reading skills. The quality of the workforce depicted by its skill profile is also gloomy.  As \\nper the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) Annual Report (2017 – 18), the proportion of urban \\nyouth who received formal vocational training was only 4.4 percent in 2017 – 18. It seems to be a \\nformidable task of training 400 million people by 2022 as p er the target of the Ministry of Skill \\nDevelopment and Entrepreneurship.  \\n \\nSecond, the generation of gainful and quality employment opportunities at a fast pace is essential \\nin India provided the fact that 63 percent of the population is in the working age group. However, \\nas per the PLFS Annual Report (2017 – 18), around half of the working age population in India is \\nout of the labor market. The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) in usual status has decl ined \\nfrom 55.9 percent in 2011 – 12 to 49.8 percent in 2017 – 18. Further, there is a worsening of the \\nquality of employment due to the growing informaliz ation and casualization of jobs. One cannot \\nignore the other half of DD that is the status of women in  the sphere of education, health, and labor \\nmarket. The LFPR of women has declined twice  as compared to their counterparts from  2011 – 12 \\nto 2017 – 18 and less than a quarter of them are active in the labor market in 2017 – 18. Though \\nurban women LFPR has remained stagnant at 20.4 percent from  2011 – 12 to 2017 – 18, it has \\ndeclined sharply by 11 percentage points for rural females during the same period. Thus, the female \\nLFPR in India is one of the lowest in the world.  Further, it is found that there exist  huge gender \\ndisparities in education, health, marriage, and the overall sex ratio which if removed could \\ncontribute an additional $2.9 trillion in real terms by 2025 ( Dobbs  et al., 2015). Also, there is a \\nhuge prevalence of child marriages in India. Accor ding to Goli (2016) estimates, the number of \\n27 \\n \\nchild marriage in India (103 million) is greater than the population of the Philippines and out of \\n28 child marriages taking place per minute across the world, more than two of them are held in \\nIndia. This has a  significant negative effect on health and need s to be controlled to prevent its \\nadverse effects on the economy.  \\n \\nThe next upcoming issue emerging from the age structure transition of the population is the rapidly \\ngrowing old -age dependency ratio in the future. According to Goli and Pandey (2010) estimates \\nfrom UN projections, there will be only a 2 percent increase in the working age population between \\n2005 – 2050 whereas the older population will go up by 13 percent during the same period. Also, \\nin India , it takes only 25 years to double its older population as compared to the US where it takes \\naround 70 years for the same. Thus, India will prematurely develop into aging societies which will \\nhave serious economic and health burden s. But this may provide the possibility of the ‘Second \\nDemographic Dividend’  as the older population aids in capital accumulation from the savings done \\nduring their working years and thereby leading to economic growth. However, it hinges on the \\navailability of developed financial  markets, healthy older population, provision of income security \\nand social security, which at present seems to be an arduous task in India. Therefore, India should \\nstart preparing for this future challenge otherwise it may get old before getting rich.  \\n \\nThe fourth constraint is the negative trend in household savings rate which is a principal source of \\ncapital accumulation and an important parameter of DD. It has fallen from 23.6 percent in 2011 – \\n12 to 17.2 percent in 2017 – 18 which has put a drag on inve stment rate by almost 10 percentage \\npoints during this period. Besides this, according to Oxfam India Report (2018), India has the \\nhighest disparity among all the nations the world on all the parameters of income, wealth and \\nconsumption. This rising income  disparity may further dampen the savings rate in the future.  \\n \\nLastly, the level of urbanization in India is around 34 percent in 2018 as per the  report of  U.N. \\nWorld Urbanization Prospects (2018 ). But there is a vast inter state disparity in its level rang ing \\nfrom 10 percent in Himachal Pradesh to 48.5 percent in Tamil Nadu. As cities attract working age \\npeople in search of better employment opportunities and livelihood, this promotes inter -state \\nmigration and accentuate already existing economic inequaliti es in India. As per Census 2011, the \\npopulation growth in urban areas has been contributed more by migration than the natural \\n28 \\n \\npopulation growth.  Also, this rapid pace of urbanization without advancement in rural areas has \\nput excessive population pressure  in cities and simultaneously leading to urbanization of rural \\npoverty. In such a scenario, it is essential to co -devel op both urban and rural areas to maintain \\nbalance and equip the youth with quality education, skills and decent employment opportunities \\n(James & Goli , 2016).  \\n \\n7. Conclusion  \\n \\nThe analysis based on the panel of 25 states of India has reckoned DD to be about one percentage \\npoints per annum for the period 1981 – 2015, after controlling core policy variables. The results \\nsuggest that the economic convergence of states could be achieved if the working age population \\nis healthy, educated, and employed. Also, the working age population has emerged out as a major \\nfactor contributing to per capita income inequality across states. But this common conclus ion about \\nIndia need s to be qualified in the light of the fact of huge inter -state variations in socio -economic \\nand demographic profiles. The realization of DD is conditional on the performance of northern \\nstates where the population bulge or the window of  opportunity has just begun but these states \\ntypically underperform as compared to other Indian states. Some other major lacunas in reaping \\nthe desired benefits of demographic change is dwindling spending on education and health sector; \\nlow adult literacy rate; skill mismatches; presence of chronic illnesses and disabilities; falling \\nemployment rates; gender disparities in education, health, labor market , and overall sex ratio; child \\nmarriage; falling household savings rate; urbanization of rural poverty; a nd rapidly rising aging \\npopulation in future. Therefore,  given India’s high levels of internal heterogeneity, prompt policy \\naction to  ameliorate these challenges is crucial to prevent DD to turn in to a demographic burden.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n \\nReference s \\n \\nAcharya, S.
