# ðŸ“„ PDF Answering AI

A question-answering demo powered by vector search, utilizing Astra DB and LangChain. PDF Answering AI is an interactive tool that uses natural language processing and AI models to answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. Itâ€™s ideal for extracting insights from research papers, manuals, reports, and other long-form documents without having to read them end to end.

## ðŸ“‚ Typical Workflow

1. **Upload PDF**: User provides a PDF document.
2. **Text Extraction**: The tool reads and extracts text from the PDF.
3. **Chunking and Embedding**: The text is divided into manageable chunks and converted into vector embeddings.
4. **Query Input**: User inputs a natural language question.
5. **Context Retrieval**: The system searches for the most relevant text chunks.
6. **Answer Generation**: A language model generates a response based on the selected context.
